[Live preview](https://nathtech.github.io/conquering-responsive-layout-final-challenge/)

## Personal goals

1. To put into practice lessons learned on CRL course.
2. To practice using BEM class names
3. To create reusable gulp build system for small website projects
4. To practice using sass

## Design Spec

[Design spec](https://github.com/NathTech/conquering-responsive-layout-final-challenge/blob/master/final-challenge.pdf)

## Lessons learned

* keep things minimal e.g. just remove `display: flex` rather than add `flex-direction: column` to get content back into columns.
* BEM names can be hard to come up with ;)

## Refactoring needed

* split sass files into partials by component and function (fonts, breakpoints etc.)
* use sass functions to generate consistent gutters programatically for flex columns
